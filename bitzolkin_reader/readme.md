This takes sheets of BZ tranactions lines and record them into a useful csv file. This is not useful for anyone not familiar with BZ (the discretion is intended).

This will create a csv file that will import nicely into the BTC Actuals spreadsheet. Arguments are bzreader.py TRANSACTIONFILE
For best results, paste all transactions into a notepad sheet so there is no extra formating issues.
